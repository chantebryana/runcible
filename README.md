# runcible
Welcome to runcible, home of the Moon web app! Moon allows users to enter, edit, and analyze daily body temperature data as related to their monthly cycle.

To install Moon, clone the code found in this repository. Make sure to use npm to install the dependencies found in package.json. Once set up, navigate to the relevant folder in your terminal and simply type `node routes/index.js` to run the node server. You can visit the local instance of the web app by navigating to a web browser and typing localhost:3000 in the address bar. 

Moon data is organized in the following folders: 
- docs: notes related to development
- public: templates for CSS, favicon, etc
- routes: routing hub for the node.js server
- views: home of EJS and page files
- zzSandbox: side explorations, which can effectively be ignored unless you want to explore the history of development

Don't be shy: shoot me a message with any questions, and thanks for exploring runcible!
